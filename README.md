# tui-theme-journal
A TUI implementation of the Cortex podcast's theme journal
 
## What is this
Just my own implementation of the CGP grey's theme system. 

## How does this work
I want to to be able to call the program and immediate bring up a template document in vim for me to fill in

## What does the current version do?
Just what I've written at the top lmao

## What's the roadmap for this
[ ] adding an initial startup process.
as of now it only works if i set up all the configs manually

[ ] throwbacks
maybe randomly show a random journal log to you.
kinda like google photos how they show you youre past/recent memories
